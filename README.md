# footballpool
Web application for making football picks. This does not involve money or gambling.

As part of my [React training](https://github.com/kuehnd96/LearnReact) I decided to build a web front end of a football pool that I have been participating in for years from scratch. I will start with mapping out my entities and designing screen layouts. From there I will plan my components and code the web app in VS Code. Finally I will gain some experience with CI & CD by creating a pipeline in Azure Devops to build and deploy the app to Azure. I plan to use Contentful for my backend. While there is a concept of user roles I won't implement authorization or authentication at this time. I will use Bootstrap for CSS only since my CSS skills aren't great right now.

This app does not handle money and does not promote gambling in any way. I will put everything I can into this repo to share my journey.
